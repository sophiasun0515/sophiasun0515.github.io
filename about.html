title: About me
---

<hr>

<p>I am a junior undergrad student of Georgia Institute of Technology. My major is Computer Science, and I also minor in History. My thread is Intelligence and Media, and I'm quite interested in ML/CV, Front end and UI/UX Design, data analysis,  as well as mobile application development in both iOS and Android.
</p>
<p>
For Fall 2018, I'm working as a part-time software engineer intern in NCR Corporation. I'm also a undergranduate research assistant for Ubiquitous Computing Lab in Georgia Tech(Ubicomp). My main research interests lie in Human-Computer Interaction(HCI), and now I'm doing an independent research project about low-cost, VR 3D video stream study, which combines my academic interests in both AI and media fields. 
<p>
Now I am actively seeking for 2019 Spring to Summer Co-op/Internship as a software engineer/application developer/research assistant.
