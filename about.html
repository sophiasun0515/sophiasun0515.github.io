<hr>

<p>I am a second-year undergrad student of Georgia Institute of Technology. My major is Computer Science, and I also minor in History. My thread is Info-Internetwors and Intelligence, and I'm quite interested in mobile application development
</p>
<p>
I'm also a undergranduate researcher for Ubiquitous Computing Lab in Georgia Tech(Ubicomp). My research interests lie in Human-Computer Interaction(HCI), and now I'm a student assistant for COSMOS program, focusing on designing a coomputationl timer skin that is self-programmable and 3-D printable for future industrialized use, like on food package. I'm also starting my independent project "MACUSA Clock" this semester, which get inspiration from the magic clock from the movie "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them" and carry the goal to enable users control the clock to convey useful information with mobile apps on their portable devices.
