title: About me
---

<hr>

<p>I am a second-year undergrad student of Georgia Institute of Technology. My major is Computer Science, and I also minor in History. My thread is Intelligence and Media, and I'm quite interested in visual design as well as mobile application development
</p>
<p>
I'm also a undergranduate researcher for Ubiquitous Computing Lab in Georgia Tech(Ubicomp). My research interests lie in Human-Computer Interaction(HCI), and now I'm a student assistant for COSMOS program, focusing on designing a coomputationl timer skin that is self-programmable and 3-D printable for future industrialized use, like on food package. My current role includes making Arduino prototype for the timer skin as well as designing mobile applications(mainly iOS and Android) for users to better communicate with the skin.
<p>
Now I am actively seeking for 2018 Summer Internship as a software engineer/application developer/research assistant. I'm quite interested in getting more exposure to UX design from the real working experience.
