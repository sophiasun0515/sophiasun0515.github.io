<hr>

<p>I am an undergraduate student pursuing computer engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am passionate about work that pushes the boundaries of human sensory experiences and bridges the gap between the physical and digital world - making interactions with the cyber world more intuitive. I work with embedded systems, signal processing and machine learning to engineer such experiences with a strong focus on human-centered design.
</p>
<p>
My research interests lie at the intersection of global health and technology design. My work combines an ethnographic approach with ubiquitous computing to design and build low-cost technological systems, adopting a contextually and culturally appropriate approach. My current focus is on creating a low-cost device that can assist caregivers in low-resource environments in providing effective neonatal care.
