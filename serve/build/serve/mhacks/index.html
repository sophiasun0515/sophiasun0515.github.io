We organized these three capabilities under two distinct pipelines within our platform.</p> <p>Ad Hoc improvisation and procedural generation was accomplished through our Neural Pipeline. I worked on the real-time playing and implemented the hardware and signal processing parts of the project. Real-time adaptive playing was accomplished through the Improvisational Pipeline. The real-time part consisted of an Arduino and two microphones (one from a set of Apple ear pods) mounted to a classical violin, which picked up the notes being played on the violin. We isolated these notes by sampling based on the beat. The note itself was determined by running a Fast Fourier Transform on the signal received and then extracting the most prominent frequency (a note is essentially a particular frequency). Finally, these extracted notes were mapped to new notes based on Music Theory, using concepts such as the pentatonic scale, perfect fourths, etc.</p> <h4 id="tags">Tags</h4> <ul> <li>Python</li> <li>Signal Processing</li> <li>Arduino</li> <li>Wolfram Alpha API</li> </ul> <hr /> <p><a href="http://devpost.com/software/orchestrai">Check it out</a> here.
