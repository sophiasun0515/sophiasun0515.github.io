September 09, 2016</time> </span> <div class="post-tags"> </div> <p>Many people walk around the city - they walk back home from parties and dinners at night, to parks, coffee shops, and grocery stores during different times of the day, and to school and work. Like any big city, Philly has its safe and unsafe spots, and people often do not know if a specific neighborhood is safe to pass by during a certain time of the day. My team at PennApps wanted to address this challenge and designed a lightweight web application that makes the ‘best-route’ decision for you so that you can reach home SAFEphilLY.</p> <p>We used the Crime Incidents Open Dataset for the city of Philadelphia and ran a support vector machine classifier (with an RBF kernel) to perform supervised learning on the crime statistics and came up with a confidence parameter for the safety of a specific neighborhood at a specific hour of the day. To provide the user the ‘safest path’, we do this for multiple routes from the origin to the destination given by the user. I worked on pulling out this set of routes from the Google Maps API and plotting the safest route on the map for the user to see. I built the mobile app using Polymer, a lightweight framework that can work even on low-internet speeds.</p> <h4 id="tags">Tags</h4> <ul> <li>Google Polymer</li> <li>Google Maps API</li> <li>Web Development</li> </ul> <hr /> <p><a href="http://devpost.com/software/dummy-qlr4ti">Check it out</a> here.
