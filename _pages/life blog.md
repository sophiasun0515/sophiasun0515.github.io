description: Outside from research and work, I have two kitties (Noel 大胖 and Yuki 阿皮) and grow some indoor plants. I like snowboarding, skiing, hiking, traveling, and visiting museums. I play the piano and little bit of ukulele, and sometimes go to concert or musicals (Rent and Les Misérables are my favorite!).
