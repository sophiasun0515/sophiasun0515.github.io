Hi! This is Ruixuan(Sophia), a 3rd-year Computer Science Ph.D. student working with [Dr. Joseph Konstan](http://konstan.umn.edu/) at University of Minnesota. I earned my Bachalor's Degree of Computer Science from [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) in 2019. After graduation, I've worked as a Software Engineer at [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/) for two years before starting my Ph.D. journey at UMN. In my 2nd-year summer of 2023, I also had a wonderful research internship with the ATG Audio Research team at [Dolby Lab](https://www.dolby.com/), where I applied my knowdledge of HCI and NLP into a fun interactive audio signal adjustment project.

My research interests include: <strong>HCI, Explainable AI, Social Computing, Recommender Systems</strong>, and <strong> Machine Learning</strong>.

Please see my <strong>[CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Glgx_QLBAbkvhkjl21ivjPj3oxYCP0XW/view?usp=sharing)</strong> for more detailed experience.
