Hi! This is Ruixuan(Sophia), a first-year Computer Science Ph.D. student working with [Dr. Joseph Konstan](http://konstan.umn.edu/) at University of Minnesota. I earned my Bachalor's Degree of Computer Science from [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) in 2019. After graduation, I've worked as a Software Engineer at [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/) for two years before starting my Ph.D. journey at UMN!

My research interests include: <strong>HCI, Social Computing, Recommender Systems</strong>
