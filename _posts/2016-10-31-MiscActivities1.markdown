Co-Locate allows an administrator to identify the precise locations of users registered to a network. This app is particularly useful in emergency situations, where people scramble to find out if their friends, family members, coworkers, and peers are safe. With Co-Locate, users can update their safety statuses, which an administrator of a network can obtain in real-time. This greatly simplifies the process of ensuring the safety of all those affected.
