As the first Object-Oriented program project I've designed that implements the Model-View-Controller concept, Crazy Poker is a JavaFX game application that allows players to enjoy the game with three AIs with card playing skills. The game rule is pre-defined in the controller and can be changed based on the needs of users. Dealing of cards is random and guarantee a fair chance for each player, and the cards of each [player will be covered until the end of the game, so no one would really know what would happen in the next round!
