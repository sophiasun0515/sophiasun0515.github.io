For a class design project (ECE 4180 - embedded systems design), my team built an mbed bot paired with a Raspberry Pi 3 that could scan for a face in a crowd. Input could be provided by the user through a C# application that communicates with the Raspberry Pi over WiFi. A user could provide directions for the bot to move in, provide the name for a person to scan a crowd for in auto mode, and also just take a picture and analyze its contents. We use the IBM Watson API to build an application in node-red that runs on the Raspberry Pi. The app determines who is present in an image and then posts the result on a twitter page - https://twitter.com/ece4180Group. Communication between the Raspberry Pi and the mbed is done via serial.

Currently the IBM computer vision software can only detect celebrities, hence the term - paparazziBot. Ideally, one could train the model on any face, and by giving it pictures of criminals, it could function as a security bot.
