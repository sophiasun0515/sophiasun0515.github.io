When I finished the midterm in Spring 2017 and felt great academic pressure, I decided to design a mechanical but relaxing game that can help yellow jackets to take a breath during the hell week, and Flappy Buzz was born - a Georgia Tech version "FlappyBird" which replace the bird with a buzz and enable users to change the level mode and so that they can either play an easy version just for fun, or challenge themselves by choose a hard mode with pretty high speed. The obstacles buzz need to avoid is not the green pillars, but the homework and exams, which are also the truth for our daily life - just crash them as soon as possible to avoid any future troubles.
