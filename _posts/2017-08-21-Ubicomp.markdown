For Fall 2017, I worked as a student assistant of the Computational Skins for Multi-functional Objects and Systems (COSMOS) project lead by Professor Gregory Abowd, which aims to develop a skin that can be layered on top of everyday objects to provide new interactions, in which I mainly helped with Timer-Skin project for prototype design, circuit building, and experiment data analysis, also started independent project in Spring 2018 to conduct a low-cost VR video call in 3D environment with redesigned Google Cardboard and periscope; Collect and train facial expression data with OpenCV and dlib; Reconstruct VR model in Unity3D and reflect real-time changes to mobile phone application; And also conduct user study and perform data analysis for module optimization.
