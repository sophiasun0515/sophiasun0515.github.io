Over the course of a year, I worked with the Android NDK to embed data to be transmitted covertly into side channel EM waves followed by demodulation of the recorded signals in MATLAB. My team demonstrated a successful attack on an Android phone through side-channel EM emanations. We embedded a message into a program that could generate the signals by modulating the signal generated by the processor from normal activity, and then decoding the signals in MATLAB. We were able to decode the message at close range (< 5 cm) with less than 4 seconds of data and at larger distances (< 12 cm, we tested this out under a table) with less than 10 seconds of data. I also configured a Software Defined Radio (SDR) for a mobile demonstration of side channel EM attacks for the lab.
