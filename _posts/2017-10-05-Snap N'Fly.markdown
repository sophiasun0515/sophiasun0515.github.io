Our inspiration comes from our daily life experience. When your friend or your idol posts a pretty fancy landmark picture on Instagram or Facebook but you have no idea where that is, you can just snap it and our smart app will do the rest of research for you, offering you an optimal instant flight and travel plan.

This app takes in a local photo or screenshot and analyzes it with Window's intelligent Azure, basically the cognitive services area focusing on the Computer Vision API. When first open the app, there will be a Welcome page, then the user can click the button at the bottom to start analyzing the picture. For now we just set 4 default local picture in the drawer folder and can be processed in the app in random order. After the implementation of Microsoft API, the picture will be processed into a URL, then after some modification of the Microsoft result our app can get the specific landmark name and use Google Map API to generate the location, then the destination city. After that, we will immediately provide you with the optimal flight and travel plan via access to Expedia.com. In general, you just give us a picture, and we can provide you with the specific flight and travel plan.
