Over summer 2016, I carried out an ethnographic study in Delhi (India), to understand people's motivations and experiences in accessing the healthcare system, with a focus on underserved populations. I conducted interviews and observational studies with doctors, staff, frontline health workers and users. In the process, I learnt about user-centered design, conducting qualitative research and best practices in ICTD.
