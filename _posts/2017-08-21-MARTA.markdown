 As a "Serve-Learn-Sustain" project supported by Georgia Tech SLS center and Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority of Atlanta(MARTA), my group mates and I aimed to design a online database system that supports query and statistics based on the live passenger flows in each bus or trains station in the city of Atlanta. The users of our system can be devided into normal passengers and administraotrs, and we designed different query methods and data access steps for those two groups based on their different needs. The system is based on MySQL and can support customers to buy tickets online as well as to see their past trip reports with MARTA.
