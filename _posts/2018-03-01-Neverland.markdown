The inspiration for this Neverland project is based on people's interests in role play. Maybe we are not satisfied with the real life, so try Neverland and be anyone you want by chatting with others in the virtual world! By creating a chat room for different categories, like the Avengers, White House, or even Downton Abbey, you can choose your favorite role to play and chat with others, in the (virtual) world you like!

#### Skills

- XCode
- Objective C
- Firebase
- JSQMessenger
