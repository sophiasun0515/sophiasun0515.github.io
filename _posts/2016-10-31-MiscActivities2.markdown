I used the Braitenberg method to develop an algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem on a DE2Bot for a class on Digital Design (ECE 2031). The DE2Bot (FPGA) had a simple computer design. The bot would visit 12 given coordinates by taking an optimal path determined using the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm.
