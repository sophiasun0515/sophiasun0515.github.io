The idea behind OSD is to enable anyone, anywhere in the world to start a development project in their community by providing access to resources and mentors through a global platform. I was part of an interdisciplinary Design Team for this project where we worked on creating a participatory design model that would enable anyone to carry out the project. In the process, I experimented with the Stanford d.school design methods and design thinking.

The project was eventually discontinued due to questions regarding scalability.
